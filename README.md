# Movie-Map(Stage-1)
This app is made as a part of Udacity [Android Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)

## Objective
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, youâ€™ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. We will split the development of this app in two stages. First, let's talk about stage 1.

## Core features

* Presenting the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
* Allowing the user to change sort order via a setting:
* The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
* Allowing the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
* original title
* movie poster image thumbnail
* A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
* user rating (called vote_average in the api)
* release date


### Getting Started
